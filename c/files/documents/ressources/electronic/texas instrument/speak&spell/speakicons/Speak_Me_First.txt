Icons depicting Texas Instruments' range of classic 80's learning/ExtraTerrestrial communicating devices!There are a few obscure models I've not included, and of course I could make more isometric versions, but all that will have to wait until my eyes recover from staring at little coloured squares.All pixelpushing © Tim Drage 2003-----------Please feel free to distribute these icons, but keep them together, unaltered and with this text.
