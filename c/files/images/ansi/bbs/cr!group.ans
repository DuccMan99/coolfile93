NEW  GROUPS SUCK. THEY ALL SUCK. No getting around it, you can't start a
new  group without it sucking. I get annoyed at people who start groups.
I  just  don't like them. Everybody thinks  that they're going to be new
and  innovative,  make  their group  different  from every other fucking
group  out there. NEW AND FUCKING INNOVATIVE. It takes a lot of time and
effort  to  make  a  group work, and  you  have  to  have some very good
connections.  The one thing that makes me really angry is how people say
"We  don't care what other people think, we're just going to release our
packs like everyone else and have FUN!" BULLSHIT. There is no such thing
as  fun in the ansi scene. The scene wasn't based on FUN. FUN SUCKS. Get
it  through  your fucking heads. If  you  say that, you're automatically
labelled  as  bullshit because you cannot run  a  group and have fun. If
people drew ansis for fun there wouldn't be groups. You don't draw ansis
for  fun, you draw them to try and be better than everybody else. That's
how the scene works. So, if you're starting a new group, please eat shit
and die, because I DON'T LIKE YOU.         -creep [synapse/evolution ss]
