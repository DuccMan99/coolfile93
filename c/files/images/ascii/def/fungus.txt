                        which is filled with lovely mycotoxins that will do
                    neat things like cause headaches, suppress your immune system,
                  make women have longer periods (just what the world needs),
                 give your flu-like symptoms, and cause increased bleeding.
               He's been known to cause pulmonary hemolysis-hemosiderosis in
              babies, too. Generically, what he does is cause "Building Sickness".
             Nobody wants to talk about him, much, because getting him to move
             out is a bitch. The only way to get rid of his toxic spore, is to
            vacuum it up. If he's living on your walls or ceiling, you have to
           have new ones. He is hard to find, becuase most people don't even know
         to look for him. He's a lot of fun...
