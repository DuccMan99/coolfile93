What is Maturity?
      ____
    _[____]_  Maturity is the ability to control anger and settle
     ( '7')      differences without violence or destruction.
    __)(^_    Maturity is patience.  It is the willingness to pass
   / ,C^D,\      up immediate pleasure in favor of the long-term gain.
  / /||:||\\  Maturity is perseverance, the ability to sweat out a
  \ \|/:\|//     project or a situation in spite of heavy opposition
   `\\~~~|/      and discouraging setbacks.
  ,##\7|\ \   Maturity is humility.  It is being big enough to say,
     |#| \ \     "I am wrong."
     |#| / /  And when right, the mature person need not experience
 jgs |#|/_/       the satisfaction of saying, "I told you so."
     |#|\ \   Maturity is the ability to make a decision and stand
     (#_\`'        by it.  The immature spend their lives exploring
                   endless possibilities; then they do nothing.
   Maturity means dependability, keeping one's word, coming
       through in a crisis.  The immature are masters of the alibi.
   They are confused and disorganized.  Their lives are a maze of
       broken promises, former friends, unfinished business, and good
       intentions that somehow never materialize.
   Maturity is the art of living in peace with that which we cannot
       change, the courage to change that which SHOULD be changed -
       and the wisdom to know the difference.
