The following poem appeared recently in INFOCUS magazine.
The original authors were Fred Bremmer and Steve Kroese of Calvin College
& Seminary of Grand Rapids, MI.

A poll conducted among INFOCUS readers had established "waka" as the
proper pronunciation for the angle-bracket characters <, though some
readers held out resolutely for "norkies."

The text of the poem follows:

        <> !*''#
        ^"`$$-
        !*=@$_
        %*<> ~#4
        &[]../
        |{,,SYSTEM HALTED


The poem can only be appreciated by reading it aloud, to wit:

         Waka waka bang splat tick tick hash,
         Caret quote back-tick dollar dollar dash,
         Bang splat equal at dollar under-score,
         Percent splat waka waka tilde number four,
         Ampersand bracket bracket dot dot slash,
         Vertical-bar curly-bracket comma comma CRASH.

WRECK-CREATION
==============
This is a general multi-purpose artack artcraft designed by the de-
constructivist team from the Ministry of Extraordinary Affairs, Peoples
Republic of Poetry. It is an artcraft that utilizes advanced morphing
concepts on the fly. Extremely stealthy in ascii environments, this artcraft
is the mainstream mainstay in the defence of poetry. It seeks out and
destroys all manifestations of anti-poetic activity in urban landscapes and
langscapes.
