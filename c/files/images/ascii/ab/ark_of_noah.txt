The following ascii artwork is from a file called,
   "ARK of Noah" by Michael Stevenson located on the
   Salvation Station homepage,
   http://www.erols.com/mstevens/live/noah_ark.htm


   -----excerpts: "ARK of Noah"---------

   A. GOPHER WOOD: - as previously described, it is a
   process of manufacture of product, as opposed to
   a species of tree, according to the sources.  This
   process, which produces a wood similar in strength
   and construction to plywood would probably by the
   strongest of its day.
                           ...a process, not a species

   D. LENGTH:"Three Hundred Cubits"  It is generally held
   that a "cubit" was a distance of about 18 inches. So then
   the overall length of the Ark would be 450 feet.

                          Noah's ARK (sideview)
       The Math
       ~~~~~~~~  300 cubits X 18 inches = 5400 inches
                       5400 inches / 12 = 450 feet


   E. WIDTH:  "the breath of it shall be fifty cubits"
   Now, with our familiar cubit of 18 inches we can
   also determine the width (breath) of the Ark of Noah.

                                       30 cubits X 18 in. = 540 in.
                                       540 in. / 12in. = 45ft.

   \                         /   |     to as a '6 to 1' ratio
    \_______________________/    |     design.  This is because
           (rearview)            <     the ARK of Noah was six

                             by hastily?

 On top of this, Brother Andrew Cummins commented:

 AC->More than just dog breeds would have to be included in the
 AC->K-9 or dog kind.  Foxes, wolves, etc. would also have to
 AC->be included within the dog-kind.

     Question: WHERE DID THE ARK LAND?
 21. Answer:   ON TOP OF MOUNT ARARAT IN EASTERN TURKEY
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
               Great Ararat \
                        ///  \
                     //     \ \         / /\
                   //           \     /     \\\  Little Ararat

~~~~     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~    ~~~~~    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 GOD's word of course tells us clearly that the ARK of Noah
 ran aground in the mountains of Ararat, but when closely read,
 we see that the word is very precise about this location. In
 Genesis 8:4 we read;
    *-------------------------------------------*
    | And the ark rested in the seventh month,  |`*
    | on the seventeenth day of the month,      | |
    | upon the mountains of Ararat.             | |
    *-------------------------------------------* |
     `*-------------------------------------------*


 MUST have landed at the highest point on the mountain
 range.  What is the highest point in the Ararat range?
 It is Mount Ararat itself.                          _      (former)
