   T-series bacteriophage

This 'phage is a virus that only attacks bacteria (a particular
delicacy of this series is _Eschericha coli_ ), and is certainly one of
the more sophisticated viruses. Upon contact with its host, the tube (
|=| ) contracts, thus pushing the main shaft into the host. The virus's
DNA then travels from the head down the tube and into the host, whereby
it utilises the host's own DNA/protein manufacturing machinery to make
multiple copies of itself. Eventually, when the cell has made as many
copies of the 'phage as it can, the 'phage orders the cell to lyse
(break apart), thus releasing multiple copies of the 'phage.

Since viruses cannot reproduce by themselves (they have to hijack a cell
to do so), grow, respire, excrete or feed, they are generally considered
to be just a sophisticated bunch of molecules and NOT a form of life.
