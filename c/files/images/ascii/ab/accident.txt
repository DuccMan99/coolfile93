1. There's a man who used to be a speedy jockey
   when he was young.

2. Now he's an elderly man and not very speedy
   any more.

3. Fortunately he knows a very nice eldery lady who
   visits him in the hospital.

   From llizard : 'Poor fellow didn't see what was coming and even
        (ejm)      though that MOOK! MOOK! was so loud, he didn't
                   hear because he was on his way to getting new
                   batteries for his hearing aid. and now he has to
                   lie immobilized with his leg in one of those slings
                   and his mouth in a silent constant scream of agony.'

4. And the friendly old lady even wants to help him getting some fresh
   air ...
