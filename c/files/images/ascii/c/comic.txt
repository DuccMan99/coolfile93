      Super Aski is a superhero made  only of pure ascii characters. Unlike
     all the other superheroes he doens't dress in sleeping clothes when he
     goes to action, because he is ugly enough even without them. Women are
     simply crazy about him and he also has an unbeleavable gift for action
     and an exceptional knowlege of  one  and  a  half  martshall  art.  He
     doesn't  speek  any of the foreign languages, and none of the domestic
     also. His favorit  group  is  Orange  and  he  thinks that their intro
     'Robot' is the best porno movie he has ever seen. In his spare time he
     does crosswords from various domestic and foreign enigmatic papers and
     looks from his window to the city dump. He is an unreplaceable fighter
     against injustice and he cal also serve as a  lamp  foundation.  Super
     Aski  doesn't  have a younger brother but look a whole lot better when
     looked at in 80x50 mode. Some  of  the things Super Aski does are done
     by trained profesionals and you shouldn't try to do this at  home.  If
     you  like  him  and  you would like to see the second episode, contact
     MasterMind...

| urgent call from an old lady whose siamese cat got hurt in a fight with   |
| her nothing less siamese twin. If he knew that, our hero wouldn't be anno-|

| thrown out of the Independant Super Hero Club, in wich the most of the    |
| members, including Superman and batman as well as Rambo from part one to  |
| three, envy him for his unbeleavable popularity, but with the fact that   |
| he ussualy gets layed when it comes to old ladies. But, have no worry     |

|And so Super Aski courageously fled from the mortal combat and left staight |
|to the dentist center of Clinical Hospital center "King Richard youknowwhat"|
|where they implanted some artificial teeth and moved the hair from his but  |
|to his head so he can look normal again in the next episode. The old mutant |
|ninja fish peacefully collected his pension from the Bocwa Bank and returned|
|to his unnamed stream. Bocwa  bank was on the edge of bankroupcy for on that|
|same day the only account with cash in it was emptyed, but more of that some|
|other time. We leave you again to read this episode once more....           |

| "Well, I would've killed him sooner or later" Super Aski thought, while    |
| being happy because of his first good job sofar, and now he caught a real  |
| criminal.  (Super Aski passed his 'Super Hero Test' by hiring an anonymous |
| hoodlum to horass women with PMS, and then to run away when Super Aski     |
| shows up), Super Aski headed for the Police Station to report this and     |
| explain the whole situation. While thinking of how he was gonna get away   |
| with pushing an unarmed man of an balcony (I'll say it was selfdefense)    |
| he noticed a crowd gathering around the old mans body, and a lil' girl said|

| What will happen to Super Aski? Will the Super Hero Club send a taskforce  |
|to terminate Super Aski? Will there be a reward on his head and in that way |
|double foreign investments in Bocwana?? Is Santa Claus just faking his death|
|or is he really dead? How many people have died world wide in riots because |
|they didn't get their xmas presents? The answers to these questions will be |
|in the next issue of THE ADVENTURES OF SUPER ASKI.                          |
